to RPN and the functions will operate with RPN. To convert the calculatur will be using the algorithm shunting yard to convert a 
string input to RPN. A stack will be used to handle prioroties. 

Features to be implemented
-----------
Support of the operators: +, -, *, /

Parentheses will have priority.

Graphical user interface to make the application user friendly.
